{note}Beware that this test will populate your test environment database with camunda related
tables. By default, this will be a H2 in memory database preconfigured by Grails - so everything
fine with that. For other databases, you will need to adapt the [plugin
configuration|guide:alternative-database], too.{note}

{code:bash}
grails test-app integration: org.camunda.my.TestProcess
{code}

When executing the test you should see the following familiar output :-)

{code:bash}
| Running 1 integration test... 1 of 1
| Completed 1 integration test, 0 failed in 0m 0s
| Tests PASSED - view reports in ./target/test-reports
{code}

*Congrats!* You are successfully using camunda BPM with the Grails framework!
